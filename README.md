Solutions for [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about) puzzles.

## 2022
- Day 1 -> Python
- Days 2-15 -> Kotlin (Scratch files)

I learned a lot from watching [streams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntbsbqLCKDs&list=PLlFc5cFwUnmwxQlKf8uWp-la8BVSTH47J&index=1) from the official Kotlin channel and from reading through AOC Reddit after solving the problems myself.
